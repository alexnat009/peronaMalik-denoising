# peronaMalik-denoising
 Python project focused on image denoising using various numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The project leverages the Perona-Malik anisotropic diffusion model and implements several numerical methods, including Runge-Kutta, Adams-Bashforth, and Adams-Moulton, to solve the PDEs.
